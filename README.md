# Moda-Go

  This is our(Bora Kayabey (S015003), Onurcan Yüksel (S017647) and Ege Çapar(S017764)) project for CS391 lecture. In this project we made a demo for E-commercial web page. You can register as user and log-in as a existed user. Also you can see some 2nd hand clothes, accessories. While we are making this project we use basic HTML, CSS and JS. We did not use any external libary which you need to download. 
  For executing project, First you have to clone project from GitHub. After that we use addition called "Live Server" with "Live Server" you can right click to page and choose "Open With Live Server" If you dont want use "Live Server" you can run project in VSCODE setting (CTRL+F1 is OK too). After you do this, you will see that you can explore between pages. 
   We did not use external libaries. We did this project with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS form. We won't need any external libaries in this project. Maybe we can make it much more better if we use Boostrap.
